# Carbs Aren't Healthy!
Cards Against Humaity online clone!

The goal is to provide full functionality of the game using a clean interface
and intuitive controls. Chat functionality is planned to be included, along with
both temporary and permanent user accounts.

#To-Dos
- [ ] Come up with a better name (seriously, this name sucks)
- [ ] Actually implement "Lost password" and email confirmation
- [ ] Administrative/Moderation interfaces
- [ ] Game logic! (_probably_ the most important)
- [ ] Let's not give the client the _entire_ user database.
- [ ] Double check security of user accounts - I'm just using Meteor's defaults
- [ ] Import cards (perhaps from samurailink3/hangouts-against-humanity ?)
- [ ] Game interface!
- [ ] Chatrooms
